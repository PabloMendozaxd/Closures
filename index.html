          <h1>Closures</h1>
          <p> Acording to the MDN definition, a closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
          Whit that definition itself would be hard to really understand what is a closure, even more if you are not familiarized with the nenxt concepts:

          <ul>
            <li>Function:</li>
            <p>Is a block of code designed to perform a particular task and is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>
            <li>Scope:</li>
            <p>Is what manages the accesibility of variables.
                In JavaScript, a scope is created by a functio or a code block.
                It is also possible to reuse variables ames i differet scopes without collisions.
            </p>
            <li>Lexical Eviroment:</li>
            <p>It's the internal js engine construct that holds identifier-variable mapping. A lexical environment also holds a reference to a parent lexical environment.</p>

          <h3>Examples</h3>
          <p>Given the next function, lets analize how a closure works</p>
          <pre>
function makeAdder(x) {
    return function(y) {
      return x + y;
    };
          </pre>
          <p>In this example, we have defined a function makeAdder(x), that takes a single argument "x", and returns a new function. The function it returns takes a single argument "y", and returns the sum of x and y.
